  - Base stats (luck, speed, stamina) weighted at 70%
  - Random factor up to 50 points
  - Stake bonus up to 20% for high-stake racers
- ‚úÖ Dynamic racer status updates (ready ‚Üí in-race ‚Üí won/lost ‚Üí ready)
- ‚úÖ Reward distribution system:
  - 1st place: 50% of prize pool
  - 2nd place: 30% of prize pool
  - 3rd place: 20% of prize pool
  - Prize pool: 5 WLD per participant
- ‚úÖ Automatic pending rewards accumulation
- ‚úÖ Race result persistence in history

#### 4.3 Race Notification & UI Updates ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Race notification system** via MessageDisplay
- ‚úÖ Real-time race results notification with winnings
- ‚úÖ **Live countdown timer** on Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Visual race timer with üèÅ and üèéÔ∏è icons
- ‚úÖ Warning when insufficient racers for race
- ‚úÖ Status reset after 5 seconds post-race
- ‚úÖ Next race scheduling display

### Key Features Implemented:

#### **Race Simulation Engine**:
1. **Eligibility Check**:
   - Only racers with "ready" status participate
   - Minimum 2 racers required
   - Clear user feedback when conditions not met

2. **Performance Algorithm**:
   ```javascript
   performance = (stats_avg * 0.7) + random(0-50) + min(stake/10, 20)
   ```
   - Balanced between skill and luck
   - Rewards higher stakes with performance bonus
   - Capped to prevent pay-to-win dominance

3. **Race Lifecycle**:
   - Ready racers enter race
   - 30-second simulated race duration
   - Position assignment based on performance
   - Reward calculation and distribution
   - Status reset after celebration period

#### **Enhanced UI Components**:

#### **RaceEntry Component**:
- Visual hierarchy with position medals
- Performance score transparency
- User's racers highlighted with border
- Reward display for winners
- Expandable participant list (shows top 5)
- Summary section for user's performance

#### **Race History Page**:
- Statistics dashboard (races, wins, total rewards)
- Chronological race entries
- Visual indicators for wins/podium finishes
- Empty state with call-to-action
- Responsive grid layout

#### **Dashboard Timer**:
- Live countdown to next race
- Format: MM:SS display
- Dynamic messaging based on race readiness
- Prominent placement above quick actions
- Auto-updates every second

### Technical Implementation:

#### **Context Enhancements**:
- `raceHistory` state for historical data
- `nextRaceTime` state for scheduling
- `simulateRace` function with full logic
- `useEffect` for automatic scheduling
- Performance calculations with weighted factors

#### **New Types**:
- `RaceHistory` interface with status tracking
- `RaceParticipant` interface with detailed data
- Status type expansion for race states

#### **State Management**:
- Automatic race triggering via timers
- Concurrent state updates for multiple racers
- Reward accumulation in pending balance
- History preservation for analytics

### User Experience Flows:

#### **Passive Race Participation**:
1. User adopts racers (they start "ready")
2. Timer counts down to next race
3. Race automatically starts when timer hits 0
4. Racers enter "in-race" status
5. After 30 seconds, results calculated
6. Winners/losers assigned, rewards distributed
7. User notified of results via message
8. Racers return to "ready" after 5 seconds

#### **Active Monitoring**:
1. Dashboard shows live countdown timer
2. User can check racer statuses in real-time
3. Race History page shows all past results
4. Pending rewards accumulate automatically
5. One-click claim when ready

### Performance Optimizations:
- Efficient timer using single interval
- Memoized calculations with useCallback
- Minimal re-renders with targeted updates
- Cleanup of timers on unmount
- Batch state updates in race simulation

### Testing Features:
- Race interval reduced to 1 minute
- Clear feedback for insufficient racers
- Visual race status indicators
- Performance transparency in results
- Mock reward calculations working

### Statistics & Analytics:
- Total races participated
- Win count tracking
- Cumulative rewards earned
- Position distribution
- Performance scoring

### Edge Cases Handled:
- Less than 2 racers available
- Racers already in race
- Multiple racers from same owner
- Tie-breaking by array order
- Status persistence during race

### Build Status:
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ No ESLint errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Production build optimized
- ‚úÖ All routes functional
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates working

### Ready for Phase 5:
Phase 4 provides a complete racing ecosystem for Phase 5 (Polish & Deployment):
- Automated race system proven stable
- Reward distribution functioning correctly
- User engagement through notifications
- Historical data for long-term play
- Performance balanced for fairness

All Phase 4 acceptance criteria have been implemented with significant enhancements:
- Real-time racing simulation
- Transparent performance calculations
- Comprehensive race history
- Live countdown timers
- Automatic reward distribution
